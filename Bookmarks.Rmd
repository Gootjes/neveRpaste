## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(flextable)
bookmark(x = flextable(mtcars), name = "table1", sep = "\n")
```

The main effect of bookmarks was quite strong, `r bookmark(x = "_B_ = .023, _p_ < .001, _SE_ = .23", name = "m1_maineffect_bookmarks")`.

Does this print as well? `r bookmark(x = "What _about_ this?", name = "bullshit")`

```{r}
bookmark(x = "_And_ what about this?", name = "bullshit")
```

```{r}
6.234 %>% as_bookmark(name = "d")
```
